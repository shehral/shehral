## 🚀 About Me

> *"Writes code so the robots behave; rides bikes so he remembers he's squishy; riffs on guitar so he knows he's neither AI nor Achilles."*

I'm a **Master's in Computer Science** student with a passion for making AI systems more interpretable and trustworthy. Currently serving as **President of NEURAI Lab** at Northeastern University, where we're pushing the boundaries of AI research through interdisciplinary innovation.

### 🔬 Current Focus Areas
- **🧠 Mechanistic Interpretability & XAI Safety** - Reverse engineering how AI systems actually work
- **📈 Quantitative Finance** - Building retail quant strategies using Reinforcement Learning
- **🤝 Community Building** - Hosting Bay Area interpretability workshops

## 🎯 Research & Leadership

### 🏛️ NEURAI Lab - President
*Northeastern University's Research in AI*

Leading interdisciplinary AI research initiatives focused on:
- **Explainable AI**: Making artificial minds more transparent
- **AI in Healthcare**: Enhancing nurse training simulations 
- **AI for Accessibility**: Improving audio descriptions for visually impaired users
- **Autonomous Systems**: Wildlife-safe drone technology
- **Traffic Modeling**: Advanced particle-based car representation

**Recent Highlights:**
- Won 2025 Silicon Valley Rising Star Award

### 🔬 Research & Development Focus
*Much of my work is conducted through institutional collaborations and research initiatives*

- **AI Safety Research** - Mechanistic interpretability studies (primarily private/institutional repos)
- **Quantitative Finance Models** - RL-based trading strategies and risk management systems  
- **NEURAI Lab Projects** - Collaborative research in explainable AI and healthcare applications
- **Workshop Materials** - Bay Area interpretability meetup resources and educational content

*Public repositories are selectively curated - most active development occurs in research environments*

## 🎸 Beyond Code

When I'm not debugging neural networks or building trading algorithms, you'll find me:

- 🎸 **Riffing on guitar** - Keeping the creative side alive
- 🏍️ **Riding my Ducati** - Embracing the thrill of the open road
- 🚴 **Cycling** - Staying grounded and remembering I'm human
- 🤝 **Organizing workshops** - Sharing knowledge with the AI interpretability community

## 🌟 Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to discuss:
- AI Safety & Interpretability
- Quantum Machine Learning applications
- Quantitative trading strategies
- Research collaborations
- Or just chat about guitars and motorcycles! 🎸🏍️
